## Court Reserve Description

**Paddle Up Premier League — Season 1**

Join us for competitive, rotating-partner pickleball every Sunday evening! This structured league is open to all DUPR 3.5+ players.

**Format:**
- **Time:** Sundays, 7:00 PM – 10:00 PM
- **Entry:** $20 per night (Free for Paddle Up Annual Members)
- **Structure:** 2 rounds per night with partner rotation
- **Scoring:** 4-player courts play 3 games to 15; 5-player courts play 4 games to 11 (win by 1)

**How It Works:**
- Round 1: Courts assigned via snake draft based on previous performance
- Round 2: Players re-ranked by Round 1 results — top finishers move to Court 1, and so on

**Points & Prizes:**
All finishing positions earn points toward monthly, seasonal, and all-time rankings. Top 3 season finishers receive Joola prizes and Paddle Up Club Points.
